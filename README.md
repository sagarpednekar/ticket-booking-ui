# Ticket Booking Application

This is a ticket booking application built with React. It's hosted on Vercel and can be accessed [here](https://ticket-booking-app-sagarpednekars-projects.vercel.app/).

## Tools Used

- **Zustand**: A small, fast and scalable state-management solution. It has a comfortable API based on hooks and is not boilerplatey or opinionated, but still just enough to be explicit and flux-like.
- **React Router Dom**: Declarative routing for React. It helps in managing the routing part of your React app.

## Features

- **Lazy Loading for Routes**: This project uses React's lazy loading feature to load different routes. This helps in code-splitting and loading only what's necessary for the user, improving performance
